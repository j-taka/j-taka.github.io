subtitle: Real-time human-tobot interaction by an android based on motion database
permalink: /research/android_hri
---

Dr. Yutaka Kondo mainly conducts this research. 

We propose a method to generate android’s body gesture by real-time reconfiguring a large-scaled motion database which captured humans’ motions. Realization of human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for the future direction of human-robot symbiosis. Especially, natural body gesture for visual information, as well as speech dialog for audio information, is very important for human-like robots (e.g., humanoids and androids). First, we propose to morph motions with some semantic meaning based on Bags-of-words based motion retrieval and Match-Web. Next, we propose to interpolate several types of motions based on Motion Graph and sampling-based path planning. We propose to connect necessary components by Key-Value Store. We actually evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed methods by helps of over 1,700 subjects who attend the event. As a future direction, we also describe how to enlarge motion database and how to obtain human natural activities.
