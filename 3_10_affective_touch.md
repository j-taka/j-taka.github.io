subtitle: Robot hands for affective touch
permalink: /research/affective_touch

Therapeutic effects of gentle touch and stroke are growing in attention in hospitals and nursing care centers. These skills play important roles in *taktil care* and *humanitude*, among other therapies. 
In this project, we pursue the realization of gentle stroke for tactile care using a robot. For this purpose, we actually implement and evaluate the physical aspects of robotic gentle stroke. Especially, we focus on the robot's hand, since this is directly in contact with the care receiver. From the experiments, we found that 1) the hand should have a mechanism to fit the surface to stroke, and 2) the temperature of the hand is also an important factor. Additionally, we discuss future directions to design a robotic hand for similar purposes.
