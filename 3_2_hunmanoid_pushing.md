subtitle: A humanoid robot pushing an object in natural speed
permalink: /research/humanoid_pushing
---

Mr. Yuya Hakamata mainly conducts this research. 

We propose a method to generate natural-speed stable motion to push or pull an object by a humanoid
robot. Pushing and pulling motions are often performed in our daily life, for example, opening/closing doors, refrigerators, and drawers. Several studies on opening a door using a humanoid
robot have been conducted, but the motions generated by the studies were slower than the human motion because no prior knowledge about the environment was used. 

To shorten the time, we propose to use the predicted reaction force as prior knowledge and to expand the preview control to handle the predicted force. We also propose to accelerate the calculation of the Resolved Momentum control, which is used for controlling the center of mass obtained by the preview control. Through the experiment, we verify the applicability of the proposed method to the actual humanoid robot HRP-4.
